version 3.0:
* fix the UI so that it looks for C browser-switchboard processes to send
  SIGHUP to, not Python browser-switchboards 
* add support for EXTRA_CFLAGS in Makefiles, to allow package builds to pass
  additional optimization flags
* replace calls to `pkg-config dbus-1` in config-ui/Makefile with calls to
  `pkg-config libosso` instead; asking for dbus-1 was incorrect and covering
  up a problem that caused maemo extras-devel autobuilds to fail

version 3.0rc1:
* reimplement the main browser-switchboard process in C, which leads to much
  faster startup times and much lower memory usage
* implement a configuration UI, which can be used as a standalone app or as a
  hildon-control-panel applet
* default to launching MicroB if no config file is found -- with a config UI,
  it's best to keep things unchanged in a fresh install and let the user
  configure them him/herself
* EXPERIMENTAL Fremantle support

version 2.2:
* rename the package to browser-switchboard
* move the config file to $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard, and fall back
  to the old location if no config file is found
* if no config file is found and Tear isn't installed, launch MicroB;
  this avoids breaking link opening on a system with a freshly installed
  browser-switchboard package and Tear not installed
* substantial documentation update

version 2.1:
* Steven Luo is now the primary maintainer
* use a config file, /home/user/.config/browser-proxy, if available
* add support for launching Fennec and Midori out of the box
* introduce a config option default_browser for selecting the default browser
  ("tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori", "other")
* add support for launching an arbitrary browser using the other_browser_cmd
  config option
* run maemo-invoker directly instead of /usr/bin/browser to avoid a loop when
  /usr/bin/browser is a wrapper invoking this script
* add a new, private D-Bus method for a /usr/bin/browser wrapper to use to
  launch MicroB with a URI

version 2.0:
* several patches contributed by Steven Luo:
  - only launch one window if Tear isn't already running
  - use gobject instead of gtk+ for main loop, uses less memory
  - use python dbus interface instead of shelling out for dbus-send
  - add 'continuous mode' option to keep proxy running (faster response)
  - kill browserd on exit if launched from the script
  - add option to use MicroB by default

version 1.5:
* added mime_open method used by File manager to open .html files

version 1.4:
* can now manually launch MicroB/browser -- while open, it will be used instead
* without --print-reply, the initial launching message seems to get lost

version 1.3:
* sniff for local paths, prefix with file:// (fixes feedcircuit)

version 1.2:
* removed return values, added osso_browser/request namespace (fixes Pidgin)

version 1.1:
* fixed wrong capitalization in dbus message

version 1.0:
* initial release
