2.2 -> rename the package to browser-switchboard
    -- move the config file to $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard, and fall back
       to the old location if no config file is found
    -- if no config file is found and Tear isn't installed, launch MicroB;
       this avoids breaking link opening on a system with a freshly installed
       browser-switchboard package and Tear not installed
    -- substantial documentation update
2.1 -> steven676 is now the primary maintainer
    -- use a config file, /home/user/.config/browser-proxy, if available
    -- add support for launching Fennec and Midori out of the box
    -- introduce a config option default_browser for selecting the default browser ("tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori", "other")
    -- add support for launching an arbitrary browser using the other_browser_cmd config option
    -- run maemo-invoker directly instead of /usr/bin/browser to avoid a loop when /usr/bin/browser is a wrapper invoking this script
    -- add a new, private D-Bus method for a /usr/bin/browser wrapper to use to launch MicroB with a URI
2.0 -> several patches contributed by steven676:
    -- only launch one window if Tear isn't already running
    -- use gobject instead of gtk+ for main loop, uses less memory
    -- use python dbus interface instead of shelling out for dbus-send
    -- add 'continuous mode' option to keep proxy running (faster response)
    -- kill browserd on exit if launched from the script
    -- add option to use MicroB by default
1.5 -> added mime_open method used by File manager to open .html files
1.4 -> can now manually launch MicroB/browser -- while open, it will be used instead
    -- without --print-reply, the initial launching message seems to get lost
1.3 -> sniff for local paths, prefix with file:// (fixes feedcircuit)
1.2 -> removed return values, added osso_browser/request namespace (fixes Pidgin)
1.1 -> fixed wrong capitalization in dbus message
1.0
