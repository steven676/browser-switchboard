BROWSER SWITCHBOARD

Browser Switchboard is a program which allows you to choose which
browser to use as the default browser. It supports MicroB, Tear,
Fennec/Mobile Firefox, and Midori out of the box, and can also be used
to launch MicroB without having browserd running.


Download:
Binary packages and source are available for download from the project
page on garage.maemo.org: https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159


Quick Start:
1. Download the binary package: browser-switchboard_X.Y-Z_all.deb
(where X.Y-Z is the version number, of course).
2. Install the package using the Application Manager (open the
Application Manager, then select Application->Install from file in the
menu).

If Tear (http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=28539) is installed,
it should now be the default browser, meaning that links in most
applications, locally-saved web pages opened in the file manager, and
entries in the Web sidebar panel should now open in Tear.  If Tear isn't
installed, MicroB will be used as the default browser; keep reading to
see how to change the default browser to something else.

MicroB can always be opened via the Web menu entry in the applications
panel (located in the Internet menu by default), or by running "browser"
from the shell.  While MicroB is open, it will receive all links from
other applications; closing MicroB will restore your chosen default
browser.

Some users have reported that a restart may be necessary to ensure that
Browser Switchboard is functioning.  If you experience trouble after
installing the package, try rebooting your device first.


Changing the Default Browser:

By default, Tear is used as the default browser if installed (otherwise
MicroB is the default browser).  To change this behavior, you need to
create a configuration file (from the shell for now -- a configuration
UI is in the works).  From a shell on your device (xterm, SSH, or
similar), run the following (where $ is your prompt, not something you
type):

$ cat > $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard <<EOF
default_browser = "your_browser"
EOF

where your_browser can be one of "tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori",
or "other" (see below for more on the "other" option).  You can of
course also edit the $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard file with your
favorite text editor.

To restore the default behavior, just delete the config file:

$ rm $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard


Advanced Configuration:

Here's a more complete sample configuration file:

# BEGIN SAMPLE CONFIG FILE
# This is a comment
# continuous_mode: 0 -- close after handling a request; 1 -- run
# continuously in the background
continuous_mode = 0
# default_browser: "tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori", or "other"
default_browser = "tear"
# other_browser_cmd: If default browser is "other", what program
# to run (%s will be replaced by URI)
#other_browser_cmd = "some_browser %s"
# END SAMPLE CONFIG FILE

Lines beginning with # characters are comments and are ignored by the
script.

In continuous mode, Browser Switchboard keeps running in the background
instead of closing after handling each request.  This saves roughly two
seconds of startup time for each link (on my N800 running Diablo), but
costs you about 2 MB extra memory.  Continuous mode is disabled by
default; set continuous_mode to 1 to enable.

The "tear", "microb", "fennec", and "midori" options for default_browser
should be self-explanatory.

If the default browser is "other", Browser Switchboard will run the
program specified in other_browser_cmd as the default browser, with a
URI replacing the %s on the command line; for example, if
other_browser_cmd is set to "some_browser %s", and Browser Switchboard
is asked to load http://www.google.com/, it will perform the equivalent
of typing in 

$ some_browser 'http://www.google.com/'

at a shell.


Browser Switchboard and MicroB's browserd:

MicroB uses a background process called browserd to decrease its load
time.  Browser Switchboard knows how to launch MicroB without having
browserd running all the time, so if you don't plan on using MicroB
often, you can disable browserd (for example, by using the
maemo-control-services control panel applet available in Maemo Extras to
disable tablet-browser-daemon).  This will save you about 1 MB of
memory, but add a few seconds to MicroB's load time.


Uninstalling Browser Switchboard:

Remove the Browser Switchboard package using the Application Manager,
and everything should be back to normal.  A reboot may be necessary for
changes to take effect -- if you experience problems, try restarting
your device first.


Manual Installation:

If for some reason you don't want to use the binary package to install
Browser Switchboard, you can install it by hand:
1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed: packages
python2.5, python2.5-dbus, and python-2.5-gobject.
2. Download the source tarball: browser-switchboard_X.Y.orig.tar.gz
3. Unpack the source tarball on your device:

$ tar -xvzf browser-switchboard_X.Y.orig.tar.gz
$ cd browser-switchboard-X.Y

4. As root on your device, copy the browser-switchboard script to
/usr/bin:

# cp browser-switchboard /usr/bin

(where # represents a root shell prompt).
5. As root on your device, copy com.nokia.osso_browser.service to
/usr/share/dbus-1/services, moving the existing file out of the way
first:

# mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.nokia.osso_browser.service
  /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.nokia.osso_browser.bak
# cp com.nokia.osso_browser.service /usr/share/dbus-1/services

6. (optional) If you want running "browser" from the command line to
work as intended, copy browser to /usr/bin, moving the original symlink
out of the way first:

# mv /usr/bin/browser /usr/bin/browser.bak
# cp browser /usr/bin

To uninstall, remove the files you installed, restore the backup copies,
and reboot your device.
