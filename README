Browser Switchboard
version 2.2 by steven676 and xiojason
(see http://browser-switch.garage.maemo.org/)

simple python-dbus service that proxies osso_browser events to Tear
based on code from http://paste.lisp.org/display/45824

installation:
0. ensure the needed python packages are installed:
   python2.5, python2.5-dbus, and python2.5-gtk2
1. place this file in /home/user as browser-switchboard
2. make executable (chmod +x browser-switchboard)
3. change /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.nokia.osso_browser.service to read:
[D-BUS Service]
Name=com.nokia.osso_browser
Exec=/home/user/browser-switchboard
4. disable tablet-browser-service (aka browserd) (optional, saves memory)
5. you may wish to reboot.

notes:
- opening urls will be a bit slow. it takes some time to relay the messages to Tear
- modifications to the script may require the killing of an already-running
  browser-switchboard process -- just use 'kill' to stop it.
- modifying the osso_browser.service file prevents MicroB/browserd from working.
  if you wish to restore MicroB/browserd, change the service file's contents back to:
[D-BUS Service]
Name=com.nokia.osso_browser
Exec=/usr/bin/browser
  and re-enable tablet-browser-service again.
