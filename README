BROWSER SWITCHBOARD

Browser Switchboard is a program which allows you to choose which
browser to use as the default browser. It supports MicroB, Tear,
Fennec/Mobile Firefox, and Midori out of the box, and can also be used
to launch MicroB without having browserd running.


Download:
Binary packages and source are available for download from the project
page on garage.maemo.org: https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159


Quick Start:
1. Download the binary package: browser-switchboard_X.Y-Z_all.deb
(where X.Y-Z is the version number, of course).
2. Install the package using the Application Manager (open the
Application Manager, then select Application->Install from file in the
menu).

You can now select the default browser by using the Browser Switchboard
applet in the Control Panel.  Links in most applications, locally-saved
web pages opened from the file manager, and (for Maemo 4.x) entries in
the Web sidebar panel will open in the browser that you select as the
default.  If you don't configure a default browser, MicroB will continue
to be used as the default browser.

No matter which browser you select as the default, MicroB can always be
opened via the Web menu entry in the applications menu (for Maemo 4.x,
located in the Internet menu by default), or by running "browser" from
the shell.  While MicroB is open, it will receive all links from other
applications; closing MicroB will restore your chosen default browser.

Some users have reported that a restart may be necessary to ensure that
Browser Switchboard is functioning.  If you experience trouble after
installing the package, try rebooting your device first.


Configuring the Default Browser by Hand:

If for some reason, you don't want to use the Control Panel applet to
configure Browser Switchboard, you can create the configuration file by
hand from a shell.  Run the following (where $ is your prompt, not
something you type):

$ cat > $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard <<EOF
default_browser = "your_browser"
EOF

where your_browser can be one of "tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori",
or "other" (see below for more on the "other" option).  You can of
course also edit the $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard file with your
favorite text editor.

To restore the default behavior, just delete the config file:

$ rm $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard


Advanced Configuration:

Here's a more complete sample configuration file:

# BEGIN SAMPLE CONFIG FILE
# This is a comment
# continuous_mode: 0 -- close after handling a request; 1 -- run
# continuously in the background
continuous_mode = 0
# default_browser: "tear", "microb", "fennec", "midori", or "other"
default_browser = "tear"
# other_browser_cmd: If default browser is "other", what program
# to run (%s will be replaced by URI)
#other_browser_cmd = "some_browser %s"
# END SAMPLE CONFIG FILE

Lines beginning with # characters are comments and are ignored by the
script.

In continuous mode, Browser Switchboard keeps running in the background
instead of closing after handling each request.  This saves a bit of
startup time for each link (on my N800 running Diablo), but costs you
about 100 KB extra memory.  Continuous mode is disabled by default; set
continuous_mode to 1 to enable.  [This option corresponds to the
"Optimize Browser Switchboard for" option group in the UI; "Lower memory
usage" corresponds to continuous_mode off, while "Faster browser startup
time" corresponds to continuous_mode on.]

The "tear", "microb", "fennec", and "midori" options for default_browser
should be self-explanatory.

If the default browser is "other", Browser Switchboard will run the
program specified in other_browser_cmd as the default browser, with a
URI replacing the %s on the command line; for example, if
other_browser_cmd is set to "some_browser %s", and Browser Switchboard
is asked to load http://www.google.com/, it will perform the equivalent
of typing in 

$ some_browser 'http://www.google.com/'

at a shell.


Browser Switchboard and MicroB's browserd:

MicroB uses a background process called browserd to decrease its load
time.  Browser Switchboard knows how to launch MicroB without having
browserd running all the time, so if you don't plan on using MicroB
often, you can disable browserd (for example, by using the
maemo-control-services control panel applet available in Maemo Extras to
disable tablet-browser-daemon).  This will save you about 1 MB of
memory, but add a few seconds to MicroB's load time.


Uninstalling Browser Switchboard:

Remove the Browser Switchboard package using the Application Manager,
and everything should be back to normal.  A reboot may be necessary for
changes to take effect -- if you experience problems, try restarting
your device first.


Compiling Browser Switchboard:

If for some reason you don't want to use the prebuilt binary package to
install Browser Switchboard, you can compile and install by hand:
1. You will need a copy of the SDK for your device.  Make sure the
following packages are installed: libdbus-glib-1-dev for
browser-switchboard; libdbus-1-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, hildon-dev,
hildon-control-panel-dev for the config UI.
2. Download the source tarball: browser-switchboard_X.Y.orig.tar.gz
3. Unpack the source tarball in your SDK install:

SDK$ tar -xvzf browser-switchboard_X.Y.orig.tar.gz
SDK$ cd browser-switchboard-X.Y

4. Compile:

SDK$ make
SDK$ make -C config-ui

(If you want the standalone config application instead of the Control
Panel plugin, do 
SDK$ make -C config-ui hildon-app
instead.

If you're using the Scratchbox2-based SDK+, you want
SDK+$ sb2 make
etc. as usual.)

5. Install to a temporary directory, and tar up the result:

SDK$ make DESTDIR=temp install
SDK$ make -C config-ui install
SDK$ cd temp
SDK$ tar cf stuff.tar .

6. As root on your device, move files that will be replaced in the
install process out of the way:

DEVICE# mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.nokia.osso_browser.service
  /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.nokia.osso_browser.bak
DEVICE# mv /usr/bin/browser /usr/bin/browser.bak

7. Copy the tar file from step 5 to your device, and as root, unpack it
in the root directory of your device:

DEVICE# cd /
DEVICE# tar xf /path/to/stuff.tar

To uninstall, remove the files you installed, restore the backup copies,
and reboot your device.
