browser-switchboard (3.0~rc1-2) extras-devel; urgency=low

  * Actually upload to extras-devel.
  * Replace the dependency on libdbus-1-dev and the call to pkg-config for
    dbus-1 with libosso-dev and libosso, respectively, as that's the package
    the control panel plugin interface actually needs.  Fixes autobuild.

browser-switchboard (3.0~rc1-1) extras-devel; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" prerelease.
  * Upstream changes:
    - move to an all-C implementation for better performance and memory usage
    - add a configuration hildon-control-panel plugin
    - make MicroB the default default browser
  * Packaging changes:
    - Accommodate the move to C:
      + Package is now Arch: any.
      + Revise Build-Depends and Depends appropriately.
      + debian/postrm now kills off both Python and C browser-switchboards.
      + debian/rules: build an Arch: any package, use the new Makefile-based
        build and install, dh_strip the binaries, make shlibdeps.
  * Cherry-pick 323bf8...
    ("config-ui: Teach UI how to HUP C browser-switchboards") from Git master.

browser-switchboard (2.2-1) extras-devel; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" release.
  * Upstream changes:
    - rename the package to browser-switchboard
    - move the config file to $HOME/.config/browser-switchboard, and fall back
      to the old location if no config file is found
    - if no config file is found and Tear isn't installed, launch MicroB;
      this avoids breaking link opening on a system with a freshly installed
      browser-switchboard package and Tear not installed
    - substantial documentation update
  * Packaging changes:
    - Rename the package to browser-switchboard; Conflict with browser-proxy
      to make sure that users don't try to install over it.  browser-proxy
      needs to be uninstalled before installing browser-switchboard.
    - Drop the Depends on tear, now that installing browser-switchboard
      doesn't break link opening when Tear isn't installed.  Recommend
      tear | fennec | midori instead.
    - Add a friendly display name for the application manager in
      debian/control.
    - Update the package description.

browser-proxy (2.1-1) extras-devel; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" release.
  * Upstream changes:
    - I'm now the upstream maintainer.
    - License is clarified (GPLv2+).
    - Use a config file ($HOME/.config/browser-proxy) for settings, if it
      exists.
    - Add support for launching Fennec and Midori out of the box.
    - Introduce a config option default_browser for selecting the default
      browser.
    - Add support for launching an arbitrary browser using the
      other_browser_cmd config option.
    - Run maemo-invoker directly instead of /usr/bin/browser to avoid a loop
      when /usr/bin/browser is a wrapper invoking browser-proxy.
    - Add a new, private D-Bus method for a /usr/bin/browser wrapper to use.
  * Packaging changes:
    - Ship a /usr/bin/browser wrapper script which ensures that launching
      MicroB with /usr/bin/browser works when browser-proxy is installed.
    - Update copyright to reflect licensing changes.
    - Conflict with Mozilla's fennec-dbus-proxy (see Mozilla Bugzilla
      #499904); both provide the com.nokia.osso_browser service and the two
      probably shouldn't be co-installed.
