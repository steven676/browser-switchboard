Description: allows any web browser to be used as the default
 Browser Switchboard is a program which allows you to choose
 which browser to use as the default browser.  It supports
 MicroB, Tear, Fennec/Mobile Firefox, and Midori out of the box,
 and can easily be extended to support other browsers.  It can
 also launch MicroB without having a large background process
 (browserd) running at all times, saving memory when MicroB 
 isn't in use.
