<p>Browser Switchboard (formerly browser-proxy) is a program which allows
you to choose which browser to use as the default browser on Maemo devices.
It supports MicroB, Tear, Fennec/Mobile Firefox, and Midori out of the box,
and can also be used to launch MicroB without having browserd running.</p>

<h2>Current Release</h2>
<p>Version 3.0rc1 (2009/12/18) (<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/7081/browser-switchboard_3.0rc1-1_armel.deb">Diablo package</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Release candidate -- not (yet) a stable release</li>
<li>Add a control panel applet to help configure the UI</li>
<li>Reimplement the core D-Bus proxy in C to improve speed and memory footprint</li>
<li>Default to launching MicroB as the default browser if unconfigured -- if you were using Browser Switchboard to launch Tear, you need to explicitly set Tear as the default browser using the UI (or by configuring by hand)</li>
<li><b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> Fremantle support (see <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159">download page</a> for source and packages).  BACK UP before installing, and let me know how it goes!</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 2.2 (2009/12/14) (<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/7038/browser-switchboard_2.2-1_all.deb">Diablo package</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the package to browser-switchboard</li>
<li>Move the config file to /home/user/.config/browser-switchboard, and
fall back to the old location if no config file is found</li>
<li>If no config file is found and Tear isn't installed, launch MicroB;
this avoids breaking link opening on a system with a freshly installed
browser-switchboard package and Tear not installed</li>
<li>Package no longer depends on Tear; should make it easier for users of
other alternative browsers to use Browser Switchboard</li>
<li>substantial documentation update</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Browser Switchboard</h2>
<p>Source code, packages for Diablo, and EXPERIMENTAL packages for Fremantle
can be found on the maemo Garage
<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159">download page</a>.
Packages can also be installed from the maemo
<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel">extras-devel repository</a>
(though don't blindly enable extras-devel and install/upgrade &mdash; see
the linked page first!)</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the binary package: browser-switchboard_X.Y-Z_all.deb
(where X.Y-Z is the version number, of course).</li>
<li>Install the package using the Application Manager (on Diablo, open the
Application Manager, then select Application->Install from file in the
menu).</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="cpapplet-diablo.jpg" width=320 alt="Browser Switchboard control panel UI"><br>
You can now select the default browser by using the Browser Switchboard
applet in the Control Panel.  Links in most applications, locally-saved
web pages opened from the file manager, and (for Maemo 4.x) entries in
the Web sidebar panel will open in the browser that you select as the
default.  If you don't configure a default browser, MicroB will continue
to be used as the default browser.</p>

<p>No matter which browser you select as the default, MicroB can always be
opened via the Web menu entry in the applications menu (for Maemo 4.x,
located in the Internet menu by default), or by running "browser" from
the shell.  While MicroB is open, it will receive all links from other
applications; closing MicroB will restore your chosen default browser.</p>

<p>Some users have reported that a restart may be necessary to ensure that
Browser Switchboard is functioning.  If you experience trouble after
installing the package, try rebooting your device first.</p>
