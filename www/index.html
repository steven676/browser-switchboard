<p>Browser Switchboard (formerly browser-proxy) is a program which allows
you to choose which browser to use as the default browser on Maemo devices.
It supports MicroB, Tear, Fennec/Mobile Firefox, and Midori out of the box,
and can also be used to launch MicroB without having browserd running.</p>

<h2>Current Release</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 (2010/01/15) (<a href="browser-switchboard.install">Diablo one-click install</a>, <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/7429/browser-switchboard_3.1-2fremantle1_armel.deb">Alpha-quality Fremantle package</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fremantle: add a new, more finger-friendly GUI, based on work by Faheem Pervez</li>
<li>make sure reconfig signal (SIGHUP) doesn't interrupt dispatch of a request when continuous mode is off</li>
<li>disable autocapitalization and predictive text features for the other_browser_cmd entry in the UI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Browser Switchboard</h2>
<p><b>For Diablo/Maemo 4.1</b>, the recommended way to install Browser
Switchboard is via the Maemo
<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras">Extras repository</a>,
which is enabled by default in the Application Manager.
You should find Browser Switchboard in the Application Manager catalog under
the network category.  Alternately, if you're viewing this page on your Diablo
device, opening the <a href="browser-switchboard.install">one-click install</a>
will install the package from Maemo Extras for you.</p>
<p>Source code and packages can also be found on the Maemo Garage
<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159">download page</a>.</p>

<p><b>For Fremantle/Maemo 5</b>, alpha-quality packages and source code
can be found on the Maemo Garage
<a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=1159">download page</a>.
Packages can also be installed from the Maemo
<a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel">extras-devel repository</a>
(though don't blindly enable extras-devel and install/upgrade &mdash; see
the linked page first!)</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p><b>For Diablo/Maemo 4.1</b>, just open the
<a href="browser-switchboard.install">one-click install</a> in a browser on
your device and follow the instructions to install Browser Switchboard.</p>
<p><b>For Fremantle/Maemo 5</b>, or if you want to install the package by hand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the binary package: browser-switchboard_X.Y-Z_all.deb
(where X.Y-Z is the version number, of course).</li>
<li>Install the package using the Application Manager.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="cpapplet-diablo.jpg" width=320 alt="Browser Switchboard control panel UI"><br>
You can now select the default browser by using the Browser Switchboard
applet in the Control Panel.  Links in most applications, locally-saved
web pages opened from the file manager, and (for Maemo 4.x) entries in
the Web sidebar panel will open in the browser that you select as the
default.  If you don't configure a default browser, MicroB will continue
to be used as the default browser.</p>

<p>No matter which browser you select as the default, MicroB can always be
opened via the Web menu entry in the applications menu (for Maemo 4.x,
located in the Internet menu by default), or by running "browser" from
the shell.  While MicroB is open, it will receive all links from other
applications; closing MicroB will restore your chosen default browser.</p>

<p>For Fremantle/Maemo 5, a restart is necessary to ensure that
Browser Switchboard is functioning.  In any event, if you experience trouble
after installing the package, try rebooting your device first.</p>
